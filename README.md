## Why ![Interlok Hammer](https://img.shields.io/badge/certified-interlok%20hammer-red.svg)

Well, we're using MS Teams; we have Jira. The Jira connector creates action cards that _aren't quite right_ for us.
Jira has webhooks that can post to arbitrary endpoints; MS Teams cards are just JSON, acceptable on a HTTPS endpoint... 

Honestly, when you have a integration product what did you expect us to do.
